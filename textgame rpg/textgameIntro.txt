Welcome to textgame version 0.1!
Let's play a little RPG.

In lust for gold and glory you took on a challenge to clear the dangerous rooms inside an abandoned castle. The rumors say they are full of terrible monsters and there is a dragon sleeping there... 

Your character will grow in strength as you proceed through the rooms.
You can replenish your health by using potions sometimes dropped in the rooms. Use them wisely.

First choose your character! 
Humans are average in all matters, but they can use items found inside the rooms.
Dwarfs are more sturdy than humans, but they prefer to sell the items they find over using them.
Elfs have a high attack ability, but low defenses and they prefer to use magic instead of any might you may find.
Hobbits are very fast, and have higher potion drops. But their stats overall are less than human's. They can use items.
